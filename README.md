A Database for Van Halen related information. Consider it a tribute for Eddie Van Halen

As a huge Van Halen fan I wanted to create something to tribute one of the greatest guitar heroes of all time. 
Since I am not that good on guitar, I thought I might do something I was able to do better. Thus, I opted for programming.
Writing an entire database in SQL, to store information about the band and the songs.

If you want your own database on your local machine then just copy and paste the script onto whatever you use to execute SQL.
Whether it's mysql, SQL Server, PGAdmin or Workbench, or even PopSQL, or directly via terminal, that's fine. Everything is already set up to go.

Hope you enjoy it.
